Nexus Personal package for Arch Linux
=====================================

These are the files necessary to create an [Arch
Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) package for [Nexus
Personal](http://www.nexussafe.com/sv/Produkter/Nexus-Personal/) (also
known as [BankID](http://bankid.com)).

If you only want to install it, you don't need to be here. Install
[yaourt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Yaourt) (or another [AUR
helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_Helpers)) and then
get the [nexuspersonal
package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=33976&detail=1). This
repository is intended mostly for people interested in contributing to
the AUR package itself.

The package was created by _whacath_ but is currently maintained by
[André Laszlo](http://www.laszlo.nu). If you want to reach André, his
email address is his first name at his last name dot nu.
