Nexus Personal package for Arch Linux
=====================================

These are the files necessary to create an [Arch
Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) package for [Nexus
Personal](http://www.nexussafe.com/sv/Produkter/Nexus-Personal/) (also
known as [BankID](http://bankid.com)).

If you only want to install it, you don't need to be here. Install
[yaourt](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Yaourt) (or another [AUR
helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_Helpers)) and then
get the [nexuspersonal
package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=33976&detail=1). This
repository is intended mostly for people interested in contributing to
the AUR package itself.

The package was created by _whacath_ and later taken over by me (
[Andr√© Laszlo](http://www.laszlo.nu)). I have disowned the AUR package
now due to lack of interest and a boring attitude from the company that
makes Nexus Personal.

If you are having trouble with the Linux clients, I suggest you try the
Android or iPhone apps, they are great.
